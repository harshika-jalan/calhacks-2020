## Route MD (Calhacks 2020)

Route MD is a healthcare management system designed to assist medical workers in allocating hospital space efficiently during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. By leveraging a Machine Learning algorithm, it evaluates key patient data (age, disease, drug history) to recommend optimal room assignments, ensuring critical patients receive immediate care. The system also reallocates lower-risk patients when necessary to free up space for high-risk cases, reducing the mental burden on healthcare professionals and enabling administrative workers to manage patient records seamlessly.

Built using Google Firebase, Python, Flask, and a web front-end with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, Route MD is designed to enhance hospital efficiency and save lives. Future plans include expanding its capacity to handle larger hospitals and introducing dynamic visual representations of room occupancy trends.
